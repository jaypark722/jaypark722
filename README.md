<h1>Hi 👋, I'm Jay</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a versatile Cybersecurity Analyst and Developer combining hands-on proficiency in core IT infrastructure, network defense, and security operations. While eager to contribute across all operational IT functions, my experience is distinguished by deep technical development and analysis. I possess proven expertise in implementing enterprise-grade SIEM/analytics and architecting a Self Evolving Hybrid Deception Platform to autonomously profile and predict attacker behavior.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Evolving Hybrid Deception Platform (2025 Orange Hackathon 2nd Place Winner):</strong> Engineered and deployed an advanced honeypot utilizing NGINX for multi-protocol camouflage (simulating SSH, SQL, and dark web marketplaces); integrated LLM, ML, and n8n automation to autonomously profile adversaries and track real-time intrusions.</li>
<li><strong>Security & Threat Intelligence:</strong> Built, deployed, and automated a full-cycle threat intelligence pipeline integrating OpenCTI, Splunk, Zeek, and Snort for real-time IOC detection and security event management.</li>
<li><strong>SIEM Implementation:</strong> Configured and integrated the ELK Stack and Wazuh as SIEM solutions for centralized security monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Network Traffic Analysis:</strong> Performed network intrusion detection with Suricata and Snort, analyzed traffic using Wireshark and Zeek, and conducted security-focused packet analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Enterprise Network:</strong> Designed and implemented a secure network using Cisco Packet Tracer and GNS3, configuring VLANs and a RADIUS server for centralized authentication.</li>
<li><strong>System Security & Tool Development:</strong> Built a custom Python port scanner and HIDS script, configured a secure Windows Server with Active Directory, and explored database vulnerabilities through SQL injection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Core Skills</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Tools:</strong> SIEM (ELK Stack, Wazuh), IDS/IPS (Snort, Suricata, Zeek), Sysmon, Wireshark, Nmap, Hydra, SQLmap, Splunk, OpenCTI</li>
<li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python (Flask, Jinja), Bash, PowerShell, SQL, JSON, YAML, HTML. Experience includes integrating GnuPG for PGP key encryption and web application development.</li>
<li><strong>Network Design:</strong> Cisco IOS, Layer 2/3 switching, VLANs, advanced subnetting, and core protocols TCP/IP, FTP, SSH, DNS, DHCP, HTTP.</li>
<li><strong>Virtualization & DevOps:</strong> Docker / Containerization, VMware, VirtualBox, Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3, Git.</li>
<li><strong>Automation & Intelligence:</strong> n8n Workflow Automation, Webhook Integration, API Interfacing, Large Language Models (LLM), Vector Databases (Qdrant)</li>
</ul>
